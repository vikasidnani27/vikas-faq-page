      "question": "Which reviews are approved and what is the moderation process?",
      "answer": "Reviews are assessed to determine whether or not a review meets Gartner Peer Insights' standards for context, quality, and relevance. If a review fails to meet these guidelines, an email is sent to the reviewer asking for additional information, post which it is re-assessed for publication. A great submission typically has the following characteristics: Comments to explain the corresponding ratings, Variance in ratings throughout (it is unlikely that the reviewer would feel the same about every aspect of a product or service), Ratings are logically consistent (the overall ratings are in line with the averages of the sub-ratings), Demonstration of experience and expertise with regard to the respective product. Please note, it is the discretion of the Peer Insights group to determine how content is approved and published on the site. Content may be approved as full reviews or aggregated ratings only."

      "question": "How many times may an individual submit a Peer Insights review?",
      "answer": "There is no limit on the number of Peer Insights reviews that an individual can submit - though only one review can be submitted on a given vendor's products in any given market/category, and you must be qualified to write each review.

      "question": "How do you verify that reviews are from legitimate IT or end-user professionals?",
      "answer": "Reviewers are verified through a multi-step process including completion of a profile with their e-mail, job role, title and details about their organization. For a review to be posted on Peer Insights, the writer must: Attest to the authenticity of their review by certifying that are (i) not an employed by the vendor or employed by a competitor of the vendor, (ii) employed by an organization with an exclusive relationship (this includes exclusive partners, value-added resellers, system integrators and consultants); and (iii) their feedback is based entirely on their own personal experience with this vendor's product/service. Have an identifiable corporate e-mail address that matches their stated company; Be an IT professional or otherwise involved in technology purchasing; Have a confirmed profile on gartner.com or a credible external site (e.g., LinkedIn) that verifies their identity, employer, and role; Not be employed by a company that has a direct stake in the market/category or product being reviewed (this includes system integrators and consultants, as well as the company whose product is being reviewed or competitors in that market/category). If you come across a review that looks illegitimate, please contact us."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I find Peer Insights reviews from actual end-users of the products and services, or just from IT professionals? Can end-users submit Peer Insights reviews?",
      "answer": "You will find Peer Insights reviews from a variety of individuals involved in all aspects of selecting, deploying, servicing, and using the products and services covered. To determine what experience an author has with the product or service being reviewed, look in the 'Additional Context' section of the review for the reviewer's involvement. We welcome the insights from end-users of products and services, and those individuals may submit a Peer Insights review. They should clearly indicate they are an end-user in the question about their involvement with the product or services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Peer Insights reviews ever expire?",
      "answer": "No, Gartner Peer insights reviews do not expire and will remain readable on the site. This approach to expiring reviews may change overtime as we continue to evaluate the best approach to meet end user needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Gartner limit the vendors covered in a market/category?",
      "answer": "No. Reviewers may select from a drop-down list of vendors in a market/category or they may select 'Other' and write-in a vendor not included in the drop-down list. Reviews with write-in vendors will only be approved after confirming the vendor belongs in the market/category."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Gartner Research Analysts helped to develop the baseline survey to ensure a structured, objective and consistent approach to the reviews across markets. Additionally, Analysts provided guidance on questions specific to a market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will Gartner Research Analysts use Peer Insights in their research?",
      "answer": "At this time, individual quotes from Gartner Peer Insights will not be used in published research, presentations or other client interactions. However, Gartner Peer Insights reviews will become a new source of information, to be considered along with a variety of other factors, by Gartner Analysts. Analysts conduct in-depth primary and secondary research as the underpinning of the research process. They also draw from a vast network of sources, including interactions with end-user clients, technology providers, and industry leaders, in formats ranging from client inquiries, 1:1 meetings at events and a variety of other client interactions. Analysts may also incorporate content from academic, journalistic and scientific sources. While end-user feedback is important, it is one of many criteria that are considered."
    },
    {
      "question": "May I send a private message to the author of a Peer Insights Review?",
      "answer": "No. We are very careful to protect the identity of our reviewers to encourage them to provide all relevant detail about the products and services they review."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Gartner collect and display information about a review's source?",
      "answer": "Gartner collects Peer Insights reviews from individuals through direct outreach. Many technology vendors also encourage their customers to review their solutions on Peer Insights. Peer Insights reviewers are asked whether Gartner or a vendor asked them to submit their review on Peer Insights. When a review's source information is available, Gartner displays that information in the review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Peer Insights reviewers receive anything in exchange for submitting their reviews?",
      "answer": "Gartner sometimes offers gifts of nominal value to individuals for submitting reviews on Peer Insights, and does not prohibit vendors from doing the same. Nominal gifts are defined as valued at $25 USD or less. Starting on December 2016, all Peer Insights reviewers are asked whether they were offered an incentive for submitting their review. When incentive information is available about a review, Gartner displays that information in the review. Laws and regulations in many countries prohibit government employees from accepting gifts of any value in exchange for reviewing technology solutions. Gartner makes every reasonable effort to avoid offering gifts to public employees, but takes no responsibility for the decisions of public employees to accept gifts from Gartner or a vendor in exchange for submitting a Peer Insights review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the number of reviews different from the number of ratings?",
      "answer": "In certain cases we allow reviewers to withhold their qualitative review feedback from public view, in order to protect their confidentiality. When a user opts to withhold their qualitative review feedback, we include their quantitative feedback in the averaged star rating and other aggregated fields under the 'Ratings' tab, but we exclude their qualitative review feedback from the 'Reviews' section. The Total Reviews also reflects the number available under all active filters, whereas the average rating and number of ratings remains constant when filters are applied."
    },
    {

      "question": "How are Markets and Categories defined?",
      "answer": "Markets and Categories are both collections of software or services of comparable products or service offerings. The difference between Markets and Categories is in how they are defined. Markets are defined by experts within Gartner Research. The market definitions are published in Magic Quadrant and Market Guide documents. Through end-user feedback, we know that there is a desire to learn about peer experiences with other products and vendors beyond these formally defined markets. To that end, Gartner Peer Insights creates and defines Categories in other technology and business areas."
